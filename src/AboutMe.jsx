      <p className='aboutme-p'>Hello! I’m Francine, the eldest daughter in a loving family. After the passing of my mom last year, I’ve learned the importance of resilience and support. Our grandmother has been a guiding light during this challenging time, helping us navigate through our grief.
      As a dedicated student, I strive to work hard for my siblings and provide them with the best opportunities possible. I’m passionate about playing online games, watching movies and K-dramas, and I love cooking. I enjoy sharing my experiences with others. My siblings are my best friends, and we enjoy dancing to TikTok videos, playing games, and eating together.
      I believe in the power of connection and positivity, and I’m always eager to meet new people and create lasting friendships. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope to connect with you soon!</p>
